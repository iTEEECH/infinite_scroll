## Description

This Flutter project demonstrates an infinite scrolling list. As the user scrolls down, new items are seamlessly loaded and added to the list, creating a smooth and endless browsing experience. 

It utilizes lazy loading to optimize performance, fetching data only when needed. 

This example is perfect for displaying large datasets, such as feeds, catalogs, or search results, without overwhelming the user's device.
